## :rocket: _<mark style="color:red;">**Hêllẞø† α - 0.7**</mark>_

* Added feature to automatically turn on `Inline Mode` if disabled. Now no need to manually turn on inline mode. Enjoy (๑•﹏•)
* Added `gcast.py`. You can globally broadcast a msg based on flags. Available flags are `-all`, `-grp`, `-pvt`. Do `.plinfo gcast` to know more details.
* Added `Adultzone.py`. Currently only gives nekos based NSFW & SFW pics. Do `.plinfo adultzone` for more details.
* Some twixes in eval.
* Updates `stickers.py`. Please Note that after updating you'll lose your current kang pack. Updated kanging on basis of username and userid. If a user without username uses `.kang` it'll make a pack with his/her userid. Else users with username will get pack based on their username.
* Added **Pack Kang.** Now you can kang all the stickers of a pack. Reply to a sticker with `.pkang <pack name>`.
* Fixed some typo & grammatical errors (•﹏•;)
* Updated Hellbot's core. While installing unknown plugin you'll get a warning if replied plugin contains some harmfull codes. Though you can force install that plugin by using `.install -f`. Use `.install -f` if you trust the provider or after checking the plugin codes.
* Added option to choose a pic on `Gban` & `Gkick`. \[Only for ABUSE Enabled users.]. Do `.set var BAN_PIC <telegraph link>` to set desired pic.
* Added new command in `memify`. You can create a sticker with honka revealing your text. Example `.honk Hello`
* Added yet another waifu harem bot in autowaifu plugin [@Collect\_yours\_waifus\_bot](https://t.me/Collect\_yours\_waifus\_bot). Simply send `.adwaifu` in a group you want to activate autowaifu.
* Problem in climate plugin was due to API. So no need for fixes. Now it's working fine. \[Got a comment on this]
* Bugs fixes and improved performance.
