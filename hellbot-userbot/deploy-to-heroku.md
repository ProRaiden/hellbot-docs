### Steps to deploy on Heroku:

* Fork & Star this [repo.](https://github.com/The-HellBot/HellBot)
* If you don't fork & star the repo you won't be able to deploy.
* Now in your forked repo, scroll down and click on "Deploy to Heroku" button.
* Fill up all the required vars in deploy page.
* Click on "Create App" at bottom of the deploy page.
* After the deployment is finished, click on "Manage App" and go to resources bar `(2nd bar).`
* Now turn on the dynos by toggling the pencil icon.
* Your bot should be ready in another minute if everything goes fine.

### Generate Deploy URL:

* First of all, fork the [main repo](https://github.com/The-HellBot/HellBot). Do not use the main repo to deploy. It may result in Heroku account termination.
* Copy the forked repo URL.
* Now run the Replit attached below and paste the URL when asked.
* You'll get the deploy URL. Copy that and paste it in the browser.
* That's it! You can now see all the variables now showing up.
